    <h1>OSAS - Once Saved Always Saved</h1>
    <p>People often look down on this belief because it seems to allow christians to continue to live in their sin. 
	Rom 6:1  What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound? 
	Rom 6:2  God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein? 
	Rom 6:3  Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death? 
	Rom 6:4  Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
